# Zeus/Jupiter Pro Forms
This project contains the forms from Jupiter Pro by Geeksoft, which seems to have been an unfinished update of Zeus Pro written in Visual Basic .NET Framework.

The forms were converted by first copying the form controls to forms in a C# .NET Framework WinForms project, then copying the designer code into this C# .NET 8 WinForms project.
Was just curious if this was possible, now not sure what to do with it so use as you please. - Have actually now started a project to clone Zeus Pro called [Ares Pro](https://github.com/63BeetleSmurf/AresPro).

## Jupiter vs. Zeus
The only difference I have spotted is the Gimmick editor, it has been updated to allow a variable number of locations and weapons. Zeus has a fixed 10 of each.

## Zeus Pro Crashes
Comments in an AMA I found from the creator of Zeus Pro shows it does not work anymore. It seems to crash when trying to open files on Windows 10, but works fine in Linux when run using Bottles.

## G-fed Source
I also came across source for G-Fed which was written in Pearl, and have done an initial conversion of the [simulation engine in C#](https://github.com/63BeetleSmurf/GFedSimEngine).
